            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I believe hobbies are an important form of self-expression and what we do in our free time tells the
                world alot about who we are. While I have many hobbies, here are my three favorite hobbies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#gardening">Gardening</a></li>
                <li><a href="#baking">Baking</a></li>
                <li><a href="#coding">Learning to Code</a></li>

                <h3><u>Gardening</u></h3>
                <img src="images/gardening.jpg" alt="a picture of gardening">
                <p>I began gardening in 2016 when I lived on an 80 acre farm in East Texas. I have never been interested
                    in growing flowers, however. I love growing food! I didn't know anyone who knew how to
                    garden so I taught myself using youtube videos. Gardening has been very rewarding because you can
                    see
                    and <em>enjoy</em> the &quot;fruits&quot; of your labor.</p>

                <h3><u>Baking</u></h3>
                <img src="images/baking.jpg" alt="a picture of Jeannie baking">
                <p>I began baking bread around the same time that I was learning to garden. Being at home allowed me
                    extra time to explore interests that I had always been too busy to try while I worked outside the
                    home. The first thing I learned to bake &lpar;and still my favorite thing to bake&rpar; is bread. I
                    was very
                    intimidated and overwhelmed at first. But once I got the hang of it, I realized it was quite easy.
                    Now, I love trying out new bread recipes and adding all kinds of fun ingredients to make ordinary
                    bread <strong>EXTRAORDINARY!</strong></p>

                <h3><u>Learning to Code</u></h3>
                <img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="a picture of Jeannie coding">
                <p>Learning to code has been in the back of my mind for years. I remember growing up in the 1990&apos;s
                    as
                    the computer world entered homes across America. I also remember taking my first computer science
                    class in 1999. My mind was blown and I was out of that class as fast as I could! I never looked
                    back. I assumed computers weren't for me and I pursued my degree in education. I then went on to
                    become a teacher. However, the one thing I learned by creating my own small, online business was
                    that I was capable of much more than I believed in 1999.</p>
