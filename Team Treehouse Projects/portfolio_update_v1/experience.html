            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m an experienced educator and have taught for 15 years in the public school system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>2011</u> &mdash; I started my own small business by creating and selling teacher materials online
                    from
                    my own blog, <em><a href="http://kindergartenlifestyle.blogspot.com" target="_blank"> Kindergarten
                            Lifestyle</a></em>.</li>
                <li><u>2013</u> &mdash; My business was successful enough to afford me the opportunity work from home
                    while I homeschooled my own children.</li>
                <li><u>2015</u> &mdash; I began teaching ESL online to children in China.</li>
                <li><u>2020</u> &mdash; I continue to teach ESL online while I make the transition to a front end web
                    developer career.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While I have immensely enjoyed all these pursuits, I knew I wanted to learn something involving
                computers and websites <em>&lpar;since I loved operating my own website&rpar;</em>. This is what set
                me off to a journey of learning about web
                development. I investigated further and fell in love with it! </p>
