            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m an experience teacher and I taught for 15 years in the public school system. In 2011, I started my
                own small business by creating and selling teacher materials from my own blog. In 2013, this afforded me
                the opportunity to go full-time into this pursuit while I homeschooled my own children. In 2015, I began
                teaching ESL online to children in China and I have done that ever since. While I have immensely enjoyed
                these pursuits, I knew I wanted to learn something involving computers and websites (since I loved
                operating my own website). This is when I learned about developing on the web. I investigated further
                and fell in love with it! </p>
